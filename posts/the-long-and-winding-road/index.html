				<p>In the course of a long marathon build-up, it&rsquo;s common to get fixated on a goal pace or how your body is handling (or rejecting) the training. In the taper phase, even more doubts creep in because the heavy training seems so long ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my own issues with this throughout the training cycle, and recently in the past couple weeks. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/21/8/1040/5925801">Heart rhythm issues</a> making me wonder if I could even complete a marathon, struggles with fueling, reaching for more ambitious paces than ever, trying new Canova-based workouts with mixed results, and just general anxiety about performance. With limited opportunities to race, putting all the eggs in one big marathon basket can be daunting - but I&rsquo;m starting to put things in perspective and turn that race anxiety into excitement.</p>
<p>With just 5 days to go to 125th Boston Marathon on October 11th, I thought I&rsquo;d zoom out a little and reflect on some pretty amazing things for me personally and the race at large.</p>
<h2 id="a-historic-return-to-racing">A historic return to racing</h2>
<p>This fall&rsquo;s Boston Marathon will not only be the 125th, but also the first (and likely last) time ever being held during this time of year. Having taken a year off during the pandemic, I have to believe the towns and cities along the route are going to go nuts for the runners when they finally return.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a slightly smaller field and with a rolling start, but its a privilege to be healthy and well enough to participate in this kind of big event after a difficult 18 months. 700,000 people in the U.S. have died of Coronavirus. I feel very lucky.</p>
<h2 id="appreciate-the-steady-progress">Appreciate the steady progress</h2>
<p>Marathon training is tough. Months of slowly building up to harder and longer workouts. Running in the heat and humidity of summer, in the dark early mornings, whether you feel like it or not. It&rsquo;s cool to look back on training and see how you&rsquo;ve progressed though. That can be week to week, month to month, or even over the course of years.</p>
<p>At the start of this training block I had some runs where 6:10/mi pace felt like my 10k pace. Now I&rsquo;m feeling like it could be a good marathon pace if the weather cooperates. My re-entry to marathoning after a 7 year break was the 2018 Maine Marathon. I thought 6:29/mi pace (sub 2:50) would be a reasonable goal, but bonked and only managed a 2:54. In just a few short years my A goal has become my C goal and now I&rsquo;m shooting for low 2:40s on a good day.</p>
<p>Going back even farther - I distinctly remember struggling to hit 6:00/mi pace in high school cross country, and declaring I&rsquo;d never, ever run a marathon. Now I&rsquo;ve got my 5th road marathon next week and really enjoying the training process.</p>
<p>Regardless of race outcome, it&rsquo;s amazing what the body and mind can adapt to.</p>
<p>When I last ran Boston in 2011, I felt pretty good about my training but had an off day. I now know so much more about training, fueling, and pacing and feel confident I can give my younger self a run for his money.</p>
<h2 id="everythings-made-up-and-the-points-dont-matter">&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s made up and the points don&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;</h2>
<p>- Whose line is it anyway?</p>
<p>As a committed runner it&rsquo;s easy to go crazy with obsession over a race and its result. And the end of the day, this stuff is all just a weird hobby (that happens to feel really good). Life goes on regardless of result. Important to keep that in mind on the good and bad days. Enjoy each mile out there, high five some people after, and enjoy the post-race celebration. This is the fun part.</p>
