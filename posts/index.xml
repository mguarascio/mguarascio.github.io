      <description>Another soon-to-be-abandoned project, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working professional with computers for almost 16 years, been a runner for almost 25 years, been a dad for almost 7 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I&amp;rsquo;m a lifelong learner. I realized recently that I spend way too much time consuming information without really thinking critically about it or doing much with it. This blog will provide me a space to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with software, running, parenting, or just interesting ideas/books/articles/thoughts I come across.</description>
