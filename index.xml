      <description>In the course of a long marathon build-up, it&amp;rsquo;s common to get fixated on a goal pace or how your body is handling (or rejecting) the training. In the taper phase, even more doubts creep in because the heavy training seems so long ago.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had my own issues with this throughout the training cycle, and recently in the past couple weeks. Heart rhythm issues making me wonder if I could even complete a marathon, struggles with fueling, reaching for more ambitious paces than ever, trying new Canova-based workouts with mixed results, and just general anxiety about performance.</description>

      <description>Another soon-to-be-abandoned project, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with computers professionally for almost 16 years, been a runner for almost 25 years, been a dad for almost 7 years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I&amp;rsquo;m a lifelong learner. I realized recently that I spend way too much time consuming information without really thinking critically about it or doing much with it. This blog will provide me a space to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with software, running, parenting, or just interesting ideas/books/articles/thoughts I come across.</description>
